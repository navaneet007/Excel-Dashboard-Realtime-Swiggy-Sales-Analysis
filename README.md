# Swiggy Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of Swiggy's sales data. The goal is to uncover actionable business insights by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs), sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance across different regions.

The analysis provides a data-driven understanding of sales patterns, which can be leveraged for strategic business decisions, inventory management, and marketing efforts.

## Data Source
The analysis is based on the following primary datasets:

    * `Order Date`, `Day`, `Quarter`, `Week`
    * `Restaurant Name`, `Category`, `Dish Name`
    * `Price (INR)`, `Rating`, `Rating Count`

2.  **`Swiggy Sales Analysis.xlsx - Analysis.csv`**: A pre-aggregated file containing summarized results, including:
    * Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Total Sales, Average Order Value (AOV), Total Rating Count, etc.
